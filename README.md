## How to keep your Obsidian notes synced between your desktop app and phone app?

It feels like I have found the holy grail of note taking. I was relying on [GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/) so far to do that. But it breaks the consistency. Also, I did not have access to all the cool plugins that [Obsidian App](https://obsidian.md/mobile) has created by its wonderful community. I am not sure if I found this solution or part of this solution somewhere or I thought of it on my own. But it simply involves using a free app Termux. 

More details coming soon...
